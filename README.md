## TL;DR

Ringer is a distributed data engine, running within your load-balanced
Node.js service. It has redundant caching and storage, with hash ring
orchestration, eventual consistency and latency-optimized routing.

### Advantages

* Ringer is part of your application. It frees you from installing,
  configuring and connecting to multiple data services.

* Ringer comes with the very stable and popular
  [lru-cache](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lru-cache) and
  [leveldown](https://www.npmjs.org/package/leveldown) modules.

* Modern web services have features such as load balancing,
  multi-region deployment, process management, monitoring, auto scaling,
  continuous integration and more. Ringer is part of your service, so
  it gets your service's operational features for free.

* Ringer is crazy fast, because:
  * Peers measure read times and use the fastest routes.
  * Cache and storage use one ring. Cache misses immediately become disk hits.
  * In-process objects can be modified without deserialization.
  * In an `N` host ring with `R` redundancy, `R / N` requests are internal.
  * Frequently-written data gets local pre-aggregation.
  * Frequently-read data gets global redundancy.


#### Install Ringer
```bash
npm install --save ringer
```

#### Use Ringer
```javascript
var server = require('za')().listen(8888);

var ring = require('ringer')({
  appServer: server
});

server.get('/', function (request, response) {
  var collection = 'user-agent';
  var key = request.headers[collection];
  ring.increment(collection, key, function (error, count) {
    if (error) {
      response.send('Error: ' + error);
    } else {
      response.send(count + ' requests from ' + key);
    }
  });
});
```


## ringer([options])

The `ringer` library outputs a `ring` object on which ring methods are called.
The ring object is created with several options that govern the ring's
bootstrapping and behavior.

When called without an options object, Ringer uses defaults:
```javascript
var ring = require('ringer')();
```
These are the defaults:
```javascript
var ring = require('ringer')({
  server: null,                      // Create a new Za server.
  httpPort: 8888,                    // Use the default HTTP port.
  processCount: 0,                   // Use all available cores.
  firstPort: 12300,
  url: 'http://localhost:8888/', // Orchestrate localhost.
  redundancy: 4,                     // Store data in 4 places.
  latencyExploration: 0.05           // Try a slower host 5% of the time.
  sortPeers: function (a, b) {        // Sort peers by name.
    return a.name < b.name ? -1 : 1;
  }
});
```

### options.server

Ringer is designed for use with load-balanced web services, and it uses Za
for its HTTP routing. Hosts behind a load balancer can be discovered using
`/ringer/peers`. Additionally, Ringer includes a simple UI for visualizing
your ring peers and ring data, and it is exposed at `/ringer`.

If `server` is omitted, Ringer will attempt to start a Za server and listen
on the port specified by `httpPort`.

### options.httpPort

If Ringer starts a Za server due to the `server` option being omitted, it
makes that server listen on the port specified by `httpPort`. If both
`server` and `httpPort` are omitted, Ringer starts a server on port 8888.

### options.processCount

Ringer peers run on multiple hosts, with multiple processes per host (by
default, one process per CPU). If you want to limit Ringer's process usage,
you can give a numerical value for `processCount`.

### options.firstPort

Ringer directs traffic to each process using a different port. The ports
are numbered in order starting with `firstPort`, which defaults to `12300`.

### options.url

Ringer discovers peers by sending signed requests through a load balancer.
In a production environment, `url` should point to the web service's
external-facing URL, and in a development environment, it can point to the
default: `"http://localhost:8888/ringer"`.

### options.redundancy

Each piece of data can be stored in a specified number of places for
redundancy. Low redundancy decreases reliability in the case of host
failures and datacenter outages. High redundancy uses more memory and disk
(as well as network and CPU, to a lesser extent).

### options.latencyExploration

Peers keep track of the average latency to every other peer. Latency
exploration is the percentage of queries for which a host will request data
from a slower host in addition to the fastest host and use the first result
that arrives. The default is `0.05`, meaning 5% exploration.

### options.sortPeers

The topology of the ring is represented by an array of peers, sorted
with a custom sort function. By default, peers are sorted by name, which
is of the form `"host:port"`.
